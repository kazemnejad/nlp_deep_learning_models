# NLP Deep-learning models
This repository is a personal reference for common deep learning models customized for nature languages processing.<br/>
Implementations is based on starter code provided by standford [cs224n](http://cs224n.stanford.edu/) course assignments.

## Models
- word2vec (numpy implementation)
- dependency parser (tensorflow implementation)
- Named Entity Recognition, window-based model (tensorflow implementation)
- Named Entity Recognition, RNN model (tensorflow implementation)
